<h2 align="center">About Us</h2>
<p>EmergenSEE Situations is a mobile phone app that gives individuals the ability to contact help in any given situation. The main objective of this app is to allow its users to be safe at any given time. On top of the mobile app, we provide an easy access push button to pair up with your app. With this, you are able to customize who the alert will be sent out to. If you are struggling with mental health issues, we are able to pair you up with your own counselor/therapist or provide you with one of our in-house therapists. As the product grows we will partner with multiple therapists across the nation so we can find the right for you that is also near your location. You can pair the alert to be sent out to multiple people or just one the freedom to choose is yours.</p>
