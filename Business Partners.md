<h1>Business Partners</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Phone Comapnies - provide over-the-phone services so our customers are able to get into contact with therapists(See business partners 2 for more detail).</li>
  
  <li>Therapists - sign up to help customers and are able to set up their specilizations and create a profile regardless of 
      their location since we are helping people across the country and can detect the best therapist for a customer based on location. 
      They are also able to work onsite but will need to be close to our headquarters to be able to do so.</li>
  
  <li>FOB Manufacturers - will produce the FOB we use to allow customers to announce that they are in a bad situation.</li>
  
  <li>Retail Stores - Will sell our FOB's to our customers allowing them to get set up and use our product.</li>
  
  <li>Application vendors(Apple and Google/Android App Store) - allow our customers to download our application free of charge.</li>

### Business Model

Verizon Wireless will be our main partner who would be selling our services to their customers through an add on feature under customers plans. We would charge Verizon .59 cents a monthly subscription per feature add-on, and Verizon would charge .99 cents their customers through their monthly bill. 
The customer than must download our application to their smartphones or tablet in order to be able to use our service in case of emergency. We also would provide 24/7 customer service help desk in case customer have questions about the feature. Verizon will be handling all the calls through their call centers. Partnering with Verizon would help us to reduce cost on hardware and software that we would be running the application on. Also it will help us reduce cost on office building and eliminate setting up a call center for our tech support.
