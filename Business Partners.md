<h1>Business Partners</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Phone Comapnies - provide over-the-phone services so our customers are able to get into contact with therapists(See business partners 2 for more detail).</li>
  
  <li>Therapists - sign up to help customers and are able to set up their specilizations and create a profile regardless of 
      their location since we are helping people across the country and can detect the best therapist for a customer based on location. 
      They are also able to work onsite but will need to be close to our headquarters to be able to do so.</li>
