<h1>Value Propositions</h1>

Our business plan is based on a software application that helps people to reach out for help in case of an emergency. There are many other companies that provide this service, but our service is unique in different ways. We created a button type device that will attach to your keychain and always in hand in case you need to call for help within seconds. We could sell our product to telecommunication companies such as Verizon, Sprint, AT&T, and T-Mobile, which they can sell it to their customers through their monthly subscription. Also setting therapists up with clients who have severe depression and suicidal thoughts in case the customer wants to reach out for help in case of depression breakdown. It can be done with one press of a button; quick and easy. Our product can be used by anybody no matter age or gender.
