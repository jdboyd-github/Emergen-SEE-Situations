## Target Consumers

#### Parents & Children
Parents are responsible for more than just themselves. This product would ensure the safety of the entire family, and allow parents to make sure their kids are safe when away from home. It would also keep young kids out of danger, giving them access to emergency services even when not around other adults.

#### Students
Safety on highschool and college campuses is a big issue across the world. Whether you are a male or female, you would have access to help when at a party, walking around on campus alone, or while in an uncomfortable situation. You can page a friend or family member and are able to share your location with them should you be in a situation that needs a quick response aiding you in not having to look up your location and lets you focus on the situation.

#### Elders
With an increased likelihood of falling or having health issues, our product would allow elders to get help if they ever find themselves in a life or death situation. While there are already many companies that offer this services, we allow a cost-efficient alternative to those who may not be able to afford other options. We also the offer the ability to page a family member or Home Health member instead of just the police so you are able to get help that may not be a dire emergency but you will still need help with.

#### At-risk Patients
Many doctors require checkups, and make sure to constantly follow up to ensure the health of their patients. But there is always risk when leaving the doctor or hospital. Sometimes medication or treatment can cause sudden reactions, which don't allow for a patient to go in for proper help. In that case, our product would allow instant communication with a doctor and emergency services.

#### Therapists
Therapists are offered a platform via our product to get in touch with clients. We will have in-house therapists but therapists are also able to partner with us and we can list them as a suggested therapist to people who may need help in their field. Interactions are not required to be through EmergenSEE if they choose and that allows them to do things their way and not have us force them to use our technology offering the customer to have a choice in the matter.
