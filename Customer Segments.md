## Target Consumers

#### Parents & Children

It would also keep young kids out of danger, giving them access to emergency services even when not around other adults.

#### Students
Safety on highschool and college campuses is a big issue across the world. Whether you are a male or female, you would have access to help when at a party, walking around on campus alone, or while in an uncomfortable situation.

#### Elders
With an increased likelyhood of falling or having health issues, our product would allow elders to get help if they ever find themselves in a life or death situation. While there are already many companies that offer this services, we allow a cost-efficient alternative to those who may not be able to afford other options.

#### At-risk Patients
Many doctors require checkups, and make sure to constantly follow up to ensure the health of their patients. But there is always risk when leaving the doctor or hospital. Sometimes medication or treatment can cause sudden reactions, which don't allow for a patient to go in for propeer help. In that case, our product would allow instant communication with a doctor and emergency services.

Everyone has situations that come up that they may not be ready for. Our product ensures that you always have that option that will be able to get you out of it. If you are in an accident, push the button and it will alert the police and/or anyone else you have added to be contacted. Your location will be shared and they will be able to get to you. Even outside of the physical, if you are struggling with depression, we can set you up with a therapist who will be notified that you are struggling and be able to get into contact with you to get you the help you need. If you already have a therapist or someone who can help your mental situation, you can have it set up to notify them. Snowballing off the previous point, our customers will also be the therapists who are looking to help clients out with any problems they have. We work to get our customers in need of help with the right therapist for them and in turn finding the right client for the therapist.

 No matter your location, or what potential problems may come up, having the proper means to ensure your safety is always vital. We also implemented the option to choose who is contacted, meaning this product is not tied to one specific situation, allowing different people to use it in different ways.
