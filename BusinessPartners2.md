Verizon Wireless will be our main partner who would be selling our services to their customers through an add on feature under customers plans. We would charge Verizon .59 cents a monthly subscription per feature add-on, and Verizon would charge .99 cents their customers through their monthly bill. 
The customer than must download our application to their smartphones or tablet in order to be able to use our service in case of emergency. We also would provide 24/7 customer service help desk in case customer have questions about the feature. Verizon will be handling all the calls through their call centers. Partnering with Verizon would help us to reduce cost on hardware and software that we would be running the application on. Also it will help us reduce cost on office building and eliminate setting up a call center for our tech support.
