<h1>Customer Relationships</h1>

<p>Safety is our top priority across the board. With our product, we are offering easy-access, customizable, help for a myriad of situations. Everyone runs into situtions they can't deal with and we offer to be that hlping hand and provide solace to those so they can live their lives without fear. We can get into contact with our customers via in-house therapists and even our own clerks who are able to check out situations for you. We make sure that you are getting the assistance you need. We are dependable and that is what will keep customers coming back. For therapists, they are able to tell us what their specific field of help is and we are able to promote them in their field. We will offer a rating system so you are able to see other people's experiences with the therapist. A therapist is able to set up everything outside of EmergenSEE's platform if they choose and that offer the therapists the freedom to choose what is best for them to do the job they need to do and allow our customer's to get the best experience possible.</p>
